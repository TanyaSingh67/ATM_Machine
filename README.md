This is a basic atm machine program programmed using java and object oriented programming
🧠 OOP Concepts Used 

1.Classes & Objects

The ATM program is split into multiple classes (e.g., Atm_machine, possibly Account, etc.).

Objects of these classes represent real entities like an ATM or bank account.

2.Encapsulation

Data such as account balance and PIN are kept private inside classes and accessed through methods.

This hides internal details and protects data integrity.

3.Abstraction

The ATM interface presents only the essential operations (deposit, withdraw, balance) without exposing internal details.

4.Methods for Behavior

Each operation (withdraw, deposit, check balance, login) is implemented as a class method.

5.Modularity

Different tasks are separated into different methods/classes, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
